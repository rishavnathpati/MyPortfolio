# A Portfolio

Themed Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This project is a personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this website is nothing much, just needed to host the website for an assignment. The website follows a generally green theme (because my prof wanted geen, not that I like it), using various shades and gradients of green to create an eye-catching design(dont think so at all).
<br><br>Rest of this part is complete bluff written by ChatGPT and I really do not feel like changing anything, its not gonna help anyone anyway.
